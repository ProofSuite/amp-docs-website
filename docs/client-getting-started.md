# AMP Frontend Prototype

This repository contains the prototype frontend for the Cryptodollar contracts and more generally the Proof AMP frontend. This repository does not represent in any way the product that will be released. The purpose of this repository is to provide the proof developers with the building blocks and primitives of a decentralized application.

## Development Environment Setup

### Requirements:
- OSX or Linux (Windows setup is likely possible but not covered in this guide)
- Node (version 8.9.4 recommended)
- Solidity Compiler (version 0.4.18 or other)
- Ganache-cli (v6.0.3 or higher)


### Application Setup

- Clone the repository and install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/ProofSuite/amp-frontend-prototype.git
cd amp-frontend-prototype
npm install
```


### Linking Smart Contracts

* The contract that will be linked to the frontend can be configured in the config.js file. For a fast development environment setup, you can use the cryptofiat-a branch of the [private geth chain](https://github.com/ProofSuite/private-geth-chain/tree/cryptofiat-a) repository on which smart-contracts have already been deployed.
(The network ID corresponding to the)

* You can also use the [main branch](https://github.com/ProofSuite/private-geth-chain) and deploy contracts yourself by following the instructions on the [Proof Cryptofiat](https://github.com/ProofSuite/ProofCryptoFiat) repository. In that case you will have to modify the addresses in the [config.js](https://github.com/ProofSuite/amp-frontend-prototype/blob/master/config.js) file.

* Similarly if you wish to use the application with a network ID for which no contracts have been deployed yet, you can do so by deploying the contracts first and including their addresses with the corresponding network ID as a key on the [config.js](https://github.com/ProofSuite/amp-frontend-prototype/blob/master/config.js) file.


### Start the application

```
npm run start
```
